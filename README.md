# md2view
This is a personal project used for learning.

The purpose of this project is to be able to load, render, texture, and animated
MD2 models that are stored in Quake2 PAK Files.

The rendering is done in OpenGL. Primarily in OpenGL 4 but 3.3 is used for
rendering the GUI which is done with Dear ImGui.
